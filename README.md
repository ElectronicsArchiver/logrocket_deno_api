# A functional CRUD-like API with Deno and Postgres

This is the source code for my article: [Creating your first REST API with Deno and Postgres](https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-your-first-rest-api-with-deno-and-postgres/).

> This project was developed to work with Deno [1.0.0](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Newer versions can bring inconsistencies to the project.

You can use this [link](https://deno.land/x/install/) to install a specific version of [Deno](https://deno.land/) to your machine. Then, enter the root folder of this project, and run the following command:

```shell
deno run --allow-net --allow-env index.js
```

Don't forget to have Postgres up and running and creating the table at `db/create.sql`.
